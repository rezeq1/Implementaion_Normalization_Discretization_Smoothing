## Implementaion_Normalization_Discretization_Smoothing

In this program i implement normalization, discretization using binning and smoothing algorithms .
And i used the python libraries that know how to perform the normalization, discretization using binning and smoothing algorithms .

Normalization algorithms :

1) Min-max
2) Z-score
3) Decimal Scaling


Discretization using binning algorithms :

1) Equal frequency discretization
2) Equal width discretization

Smoothing algorithms :

1) Simple Moving Average
2) Weighted Moving Average
3) Exponential Moving Average
4) Smoothing by bin boundary
5) Smoothing by bin mean
